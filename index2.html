							❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
							My dearest Tom,<br>
							
							When I am with you, time seems to slow down, and the world around us fades away. Your smile brightens my day, and the sound of your laughter is like music to my ears. I am captivated by the way your eyes sparkle, and I find myself lost in their gentle gaze.<br>
							
							Our connection runs deeper than words can express. It is a bond forged through shared experiences, quiet moments, and the exchange of dreams and hopes. In your arms, I feel a sense of peace and belonging that I have never known elsewhere.<br>
							
							Each day, my love for you grows stronger, like a flower blossoming in the warmth of the sun. You have become an integral part of my life, a source of joy, comfort, and inspiration. I cherish every moment we spend together, and I look forward to building a future filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.<br>
							
							My heart is yours, Siyuan, now and forever. I am grateful for the love we share and the unbreakable bond that ties us together.<br>
							
							Yours always,<br>
							Haruto❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
